# Rekognition-Image-Tagger

This project is a Python-based tool that uses **Amazon Rekognition** to automatically analyze images stored in **Amazon S3**, detect objects and scenes, and draw bounding boxes around them with confidence scores. It then uploads the labeled image back to S3 with public access.
